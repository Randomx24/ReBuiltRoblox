                Builders Club is a premium service that enhances the ROBLOX experience.</p>
            <p>
                Builders Club memberships give kids the ability to create and manage multiple structures
                and environments. Builders Club members also gain the ability to earn ROBLOX currency
                &#151; called "ROBUX" &#151; which can be used to purchase premium items in the
                ROBLOX catalog. These items enable much greater (i.e. much cooler!) customization
                of users' avatars and their interactive creations.</p>
            <p>
                In addition, Builders Club members gain the ability to promote their creations in
                the ROBLOX catalog and sell them to other members using the virtual ROBLOX economy.</p>
            <p>
                Finally, unlike free account holders, Builders Club members will no longer be exposed
                to, or distracted by, on screen advertisements.</p>
            <p>

                ROBLOX accepts payment via all major credit cards for Monthly, 6 and 12 Month memberships.
                Monthly memberships are automatically recurring. We also accept PayPal for 6 and

                All transactions on ROBLOX use secure commercial-grade encryption. Furthermore,
                information relating to your payment (such as your credit card number) never resides
                on our servers. All of our online transactions are processed by PayPal, a trusted
                name in internet commerce.

        <div>
            <p>
                All prices are in US dollars. However, most online payment methods will convert
                currencies at the current bank rate. Ask your credit card company or banking institution
                about currency conversion fees or other fees.

                <strong>PayPal:</strong> If your PayPal account charges directly to a credit card,
                your membership will usually be activated within one day. If your PayPal account

                Only monthly subscriptions paid via credit card will autorenew, in order to ensure

                You will not lose your account, but you will lose your Builders Club membership
                status and all of its benefits, including your monthly ROBUX stipend and the Builders
                Club badge. You will keep all of your data, including all shirts, pants, and other
                assets that you have made. You will also keep your current ROBUX and Tickets balance.
                Memberships can be re-subscribed at any time.

                Yes. Simply go to the Builders Club page and buy an extension to your account. This
                will extend your current Builders Club by the duration purchased. A 6-month extension,
                for example, will add 6 months to your current expiration date. By definition, extensions
                extend an account type (regular, Turbo, or Outrageous) with the same priveleges.

                Yes. Go to the Builders Club page and buy a Turbo Builders Club upgrade. An upgrade
                from Builders Club to Turbo Builders Club will instantly grant you Turbo Builders
                Club membership. The days left on your current membership will be converted into

                Club benefits with regular Builders Club benefits. The days left on your current

                Turbo Builders Club members cannot downgrade to regular Builders Club. Either one

        <div>
            <p>
                When upgrading or downgrading memberships, ROBLOX immediately replaces the existing
                membership benefits with the purchased benefits. ROBLOX also converts any remaining
                days on the current membership into an equivalent number of days of the new membership
                type, and adds those days to the amount purchased. When upgrading, regular Builders
                Club days are divided by 2 to convert to Turbo Builders Club days. When downgrading,
                Turbo Builders Club days are multiplied by 2 to convert to regular Builders Club
                days.
            </p>
            <p>
                Example: A user has 20 days left on a 6-month regular Builders Club membership.
                He upgrades to a 12-month Turbo Builders Club membership. Three things happen: (1)
                he immediately gets the Turbo Builders Club benefits; (2) his credit card is immediately
                charged; and, (3) his 20 days of regular Builders Club are converted to 10 days
                of Turbo Builders Club and added to the 12-month Turbo membership period, for a
                total of 12 months and 10 days of Turbo Builders Club.
            </p>
            <p>
                Likewise, 3 regular Builders Club days convert to 1 Outrageous Builders Club day.
                3 Turbo Builders Club days convert to 2 Outrageous Builders Club days.

            <a name="MembershipRecurring">Can I change from or to a recurring monthly membership?</a></div>
        <div>
            <p>
                Yes. You can change from a monthly recurring membership to any other membership
                at any time. When doing so, your current recurring charges will be cancelled and
                you will be charged for the new membership. You can also change from a fixed-month
                to recurring membership; for these changes, your monthly charges will begin after
                the converted days from the current membership are used up (see <a href="#MembershipConversion">
                    Membership Conversions</a> for conversion details). In all cases, like all account
                changes, the terms of the new membership apply immediately.
            </p>
            <p>
                Example: A user has 20 days left on a 6-month regular Builders Club membership.
                He upgrades to a monthly recurring Turbo Builders Club membership. Three things
                happen: (1) he immediately gets the Turbo Builders Club benefits; (2) his credit
                card is immediately charged; and, (3) his 20 days of regular Builders Club are converted
                to 10 days of Turbo Builders Club, moving the first recurring charge to 40 days
